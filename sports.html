                <p>I ran cross country from 5th grade to senior year. I am now a head coach at a local middle school. Some of my favorite memories are being an alternate
                 for a state winning team as a sophomore, placing ninth at districts as a senior, and the last week of practice as a coach.</p>

                <h1 class="heading">Track</h1>
                <p>I participated in track as freshman, junior, and senior. Some of my favorite memories are running 2:10 for the first time, running the 4x400 relay,
                    and junior year track season.

                <h1 class="heading">Basketball</h1>
                <p>I played basketball in middle school and also as junior and senior. I love playing pickup with friends and also joining 3on3 tournaments. I like watching
                    the NBA. The Chicago Bulls are my favorite team in the league. A good memory I have relating to basketball are going to a Bulls vs Blazers game 
                    in Portland and seeing Zach Lavine score 33 points. Another good memory is dunking for the first time.

                <p>I did knowledge bowl as a sophomore and senior. Senior year we placed 2nd at state. My favorite memory is getting a question right using a dinosaur 
                    hotwheels car at the state meet.
